# Airline_Analysis
Leveraging big data tools for airline data analysis.
# Methodology Used
The methodology involved using PySpark, a powerful distributed computing framework, to load and preprocess the data. Various data preprocessing techniques such as cleaning, transformation, and aggregation were applied to the data using PySpark's extensive data processing capabilities.
Then, a machine learning regression model was employed to predict delays based on the processed data. PySpark's efficient processing allowed for the model to be trained quickly on large amounts of data.
Finally, the results of the analysis were integrated into Tableau, a popular data visualization tool. This allowed for the data to be presented in a user-friendly and interactive manner, making it easier for analysts and stakeholders to explore and interpret the findings. Overall, the methodology involved a combination of big data processing, machine learning, and data visualization techniques to gain insights from the data.
# Installations
Tools required -
1. Notebook
2. Tableau
3. Spark 
# Usage Instructions
1. Load the data set into Pyspark Dataframe.
2. Run all the sql queries to extract insights of the data.
3. Write the data to a Csv File
4. Use the CSV file to visulize the analyzed data in Tableau.
# Conclusion
In conclusion, this project involves data loading, data exploration, and data cleaning using PySpark's built-in functions.The project also includes the usage of PySpark's Logistic Regression estimator for building a logistic regression model to predict if there is any delay in flights. Overall, the Airline Analysis project 
provides a comprehensive introduction to PySpark and its application in analyzing flights data for insights and decision-making in the airline industry.
One key finding from the results of data analysis using Spark and visualization with Tableau is the importance of data visualization in enhancing the understanding of datasets. The top 5 origin and destination airports for total flights in 2015, the airports with the highest number of cancelled flights, and the airlines with the most flights operated in 2015 were among the notable insights gained. These findings highlight the significance of leveraging data visualization techniques to uncover meaningful insights and communicate them effectively.

# Airline_Analysis
Leveraging big data tools for airline data analysis using Spark tools

# Methodology Used
The methodology involved using PySpark, a powerful distributed computing framework, to load and preprocess the data. Various data preprocessing techniques such as cleaning, transformation, and aggregation were applied to the data using PySpark's extensive data processing capabilities.
Then, a machine learning regression model was employed to predict delays based on the processed data. PySpark's efficient processing allowed for the model to be trained quickly on large amounts of data.
Finally, the results of the analysis were integrated into Tableau, a popular data visualization tool. This allowed for the data to be presented in a user-friendly and interactive manner, making it easier for analysts and stakeholders to explore and interpret the findings. Overall, the methodology involved a combination of big data processing, machine learning, and data visualization techniques to gain insights from the data.
